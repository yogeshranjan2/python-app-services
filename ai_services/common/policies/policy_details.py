information_security_policy_text = """
This policy defines the mandatory minimum information security requirements for the entity as defined below in Section 3.0 Scope. Any entity may, 
based on its individual business needs and specific legal and federal requirements, exceed the security requirements put forth in this document, but 
must, at a minimum, achieve the security levels required by this policy.

This policy acts as an umbrella document to all other security policies and associated standards.  This policy defines the responsibility to:
	•	protect and maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information and related infrastructure assets;
	•	manage the risk of security exposure or compromise;
	•	assure a secure and stable information technology (IT) environment;
	•	identify and respond to events involving information asset misuse, loss or unauthorized disclosure;
	•	monitor systems for anomalies that might indicate compromise; and
	•	promote and increase the awareness of information security. 
Failure to secure and protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information assets in today’s highly networked environment can 
damage or shut down systems that operate critical infrastructure, financial and business transactions and vital government functions; compromise data; 
and result in legal and regulatory non-compliance. This policy benefits entities by defining a framework that will assure appropriate measures are 
in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data; and assure staff and all other affiliates understand their role and responsibilities, 
have adequate knowledge of security policy, procedures and practices and know how to protect information.

Information Statement
	•	Organizational Security
	•	Information security requires both an information risk management function and an information technology security function.  Depending on the structure of the entity, an individual or group can serve in both roles or a separate individual or group can be designated for each role.  It is recommended that these functions be performed by a high-level executive or a group that includes high level executives.
	•	Each entity must designate an individual or group to be responsible for the risk management function assuring that:
	•	risk-related considerations for information assets and individual information systems, including authorization decisions, are viewed as an enterprise with regard to the overall strategic goals and objectives of carrying out its core missions and business functions; and 
	•	the management of information assets and information system-related security risks is consistent, reflects the risk tolerance, and is considered along with other types of risks, to ensure mission/business success.
	•	Each entity must designate an individual or group to be responsible for the technical information security function.   For purposes of clarity and readability, this policy will refer to the individual, or group, designated as the Information Security Officer (ISO)/designated security representative.  This function will be responsible for evaluating and advising on information security risks.  
	•	Information security risk decisions must be made through consultation with both function areas described in a. above.

Software Development Life Cycle:
The systems development life cycle is a project management technique that divides
complex projects into smaller, more easily managed segments or phases. Segmenting
projects allows managers to verify the successful completion of project phases before
allocating resources to subsequent phases.
Software development projects typically include initiation, planning, design, development,
testing, implementation, and maintenance phases. However, the phases may be divided
differently depending on the organization involved. For example, initial project activities
might be designated as request, requirements-definition, and planning phases, or
initiation, concept-development, and planning phases. End users of the system under
development should be involved in reviewing the output of each phase to ensure the
system is being built to deliver the needed functionality.

Initiation Phase
Careful oversight is required to ensure projects support strategic business objectives and
resources are effectively implemented into an organization's enterprise architecture. The
initiation phase begins when an opportunity to add, improve, or correct a system is
identified and formally requested through the presentation of a business case. The
business case should, at a minimum, describe a proposal's purpose, identify expected
benefits, and explain how the proposed system supports one of the organization's
business strategies. The business case should also identify alternative solutions and
detail as many informational, functional, and network requirements as possible.
The presentation of a business case provides a point for managers to reject a proposal
before they allocate resources to a formal feasibility study. When evaluating software
development requests (and during subsequent feasibility and design analysis),
management should consider input from all affected parties. Management should also
closely evaluate the necessity of each requested functional requirement. A single
software feature approved during the initiation phase can require several design
documents and hundreds of lines of code. It can also increase testing, documentation,
and support requirements. Therefore, the initial rejection of unnecessary features can
significantly reduce the resources required to complete a project.

Planning Phase
The planning phase is the most critical step in completing development, acquisition, and
maintenance projects. Careful planning, particularly in the early stages of a project, is
necessary to coordinate activities and manage project risks effectively. The depth and
formality of project plans should be commensurate with the characteristics and risks of a
given project.
Project plans refine the information gathered during the initiation phase by further
identifying the specific activities and resources required to complete a project.

Design Phase
The design phase involves converting the informational, functional, and network
requirements identified during the initiation and planning phases into unified design
specifications that developers use to script programs during the development phase.
Program designs are constructed in various ways. Using a top-down approach,
designers first identify and link major program components and interfaces, then expand
design layouts as they identify and link smaller subsystems and connections. Using a
bottom-up approach, designers first identify and link minor program components and
interfaces, then expand design layouts as they identify and link larger systems and
connections.

Application Control Standards
Application controls include policies and procedures associated with user activities and
the automated controls designed into applications. Controls should be in place to
address both batch and on-line environments. Standards should address procedures to
ensure management appropriately approves and control overrides. Refer to the IT
Handbook's "Operations Booklet" for details relating to operational controls.
Designing appropriate security, audit, and automated controls into applications is a
challenging task. Often, because of the complexity of data flows, program logic, client/
server connections, and network interfaces, organizations cannot identify the exact type
and placement of the features until interrelated functions are identified in the design and
development phases. However, the security, integrity, and reliability of an application is
enhanced if management considers security, audit, and automated control features at
the onset of a project and includes them as soon as possible in application and system
designs. Adding controls late in the development process or when applications are in
production is more expensive, time consuming, and usually results in less effective
controls.

Development Phase
The development phase involves converting design specifications into executable
programs. Effective development standards include requirements that programmers and
other project participants discuss design specifications before programming begins. The
procedures help ensure programmers clearly understand program designs and
functional requirements.
Programmers use various techniques to develop computer programs. The large
transaction-oriented programs associated with financial institutions have traditionally
been developed using procedural programming techniques. Procedural programming
involves the line-by-line scripting of logical instructions that are combined to form a
program.

Development Standards
Development standards should be in place to address the responsibilities of application
and system programmers. Application programmers are responsible for developing and
maintaining end-user applications. System programmers are responsible for developing
and maintaining internal and open-source operating system programs that link
application programs to system software and subsequently to hardware. Managers
should thoroughly understand development and production environments to ensure they
appropriately assign programmer responsibilities.
Development standards should prohibit a programmer's access to data, programs,
utilities, and systems outside their individual responsibilities. Library controls can be used
to manage access to, and the movement of programs between, development, testing,
and production environments. Management should also establish standards requiring
programmers to document completed programs and test results thoroughly. Appropriate
documentation enhances a programmer's ability to correct programming errors and
modify production programs.
Coding standards, which address issues such as the selection of programming
languages and tools, the layout or format of scripted code, and the naming conventions
of code routines and program libraries, are outside the scope of this document. However,
standardized, yet flexible, coding standards enhance an organization's ability to
decrease coding defects and increase the security, reliability, and maintainability of
application programs. Examiners should evaluate an organization's coding standards
and related code review procedures.

Library Controls
Libraries are collections of stored documentation, programs, and data. Program libraries
include reusable program routines or modules stored in source or object code formats.
Program libraries allow programmers to access frequently used routines and add them to
programs without having to rewrite the code. Dynamic link libraries include executable
code programs can automatically run as part of larger applications.

Version Controls
Library controls facilitate software version controls. Version controls provide a means to
systematically retain chronological copies of revised programs and program
documentation.

Software Documentation
Organizations should maintain detailed documentation for each application and
application system in production. Thorough documentation enhances an organization's
ability to understand functional, security, and control features and improves its ability to
use and maintain the software. The documentation should contain detailed application
descriptions, programming documentation, and operating instructions. Standards should
be in place that identify the type and format of required documentation such as system
narratives, flowcharts, and any special system coding, internal controls, or file layouts not
identified within individual application documentation.

Testing Phase
The testing phase requires organizations to complete various tests to ensure the
accuracy of programmed code, the inclusion of expected functionality, and the
interoperability of applications and other network components. Thorough testing is critical
to ensuring systems meet organizational and end-user requirements.
If organizations use effective project management techniques, they will complete test
plans while developing applications, prior to entering the testing phase. Weak project
management techniques or demands to complete projects quickly may pressure
organizations to develop test plans at the start of the testing phase. Test plans created
during initial project phases enhance an organization's ability to create detailed tests.
The use of detailed test plans significantly increases the likelihood that testers will
identify weaknesses before products are implemented.

Implementation Phase
The implementation phase involves installing approved applications into production
environments. Primary tasks include announcing the implementation schedule, training
end users, and installing the product. Additionally, organizations should input and verify
data, configure and test system and security parameters, and conduct postimplementation reviews. Management should circulate implementation schedules to all
affected parties and should notify users of any implementation responsibilities.
